  <div class="entry">
    Welcome to Squishifier! Use this platform to build inflatable prototypes with your 3D printer while upcycling household waste, such as packging materials. Start by printing out useful add-ons for your 3D printer. You can download the required .STL files from the <strong>Tools</strong> tab. Then move on to the <strong>Slicer</strong> tab to turn your 3D geometries into .GCODE files for inflatable prototyping. The method utilises the heated up nozzle of your 3D printer to seal layers of plastic sheets together. Finally, integrate new functions into your .GCODE with the help of the code snippets available on the <strong>Library</strong> tab, allowing you to create multi-layered inflatables and more.
