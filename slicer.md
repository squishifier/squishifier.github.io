## Slicer

Use the online slicer tool <strong><a href="https://docs.grid.space/projects/kiri-moto" target="_blank">Kiri:Moto</a></strong> to create .GCODE files from .OBJ, .STL or .3MF files. Additionally, you can also import .SVG, .JPG or .PNG files. These will be extruded by the software to create slicable 3D geometries. Once you are done slicing, you can export your .GCODE file and use it to run your 3D printer. To allow for an easier setup, you can download the <strong><a href="/objects/squishifier.km" download="squishifier.km">Squishifier</a></strong> file with a .KM extension, and upload it into the Kiri:Moto slicer by dragging the file over the interface to import the most suitable machine settings. The header and the footer were adapted from the <strong><a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/therms-up/overview/" target="_blank">Therms-Up!</a></strong> project.
